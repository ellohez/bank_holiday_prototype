# Calendar publishing project
## Prototype for user interface
[Uses the GOV.UK prototype kit](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/)

The Calendar type will include the following types of documents:
- Bank holidays
- Clocks change

The aim of this project is to empower Content Designers to edit and publish updates to the pages mentioned above, rather than relying on developers to do so. 
It will therefore also free up development time, allowing developers to focus on more critical work. 
The user interface will be used internally by content designers to edit and publish new editions of the document types. 

### Run the kit
- Download the files
- In your terminal run:
```
  npm run dev
```
- Go to localhost:3000 in your browser.
